## Description

This is a group project to generate a machine learning model to help us classify between three species of penguins: Ad√©lie, Chinstrap and Gentoo.

## Purpose

This is a course project for **CP 468 Artifical Intelligence**, at **Wilfrid Laurier University**.

## Algorithms Used

We have selected three different machine learning algorithms for the project: Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN).

## Dataset Used

The dataset we will be using is the, Palmer penguins dataset by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman.

## Installation

In order to run and execute the project, you may choose to use the Jupyter Notebook or run the code on Google Colabs.

Insert **penguins.csv** in the same directory as the notebook.

You are now ready to run the notebook.
